# Reddit-Annotation-Project
Our group, The San Annotations, were responsible to create and write-up guidelines that would instruct the annotators on how we wanted the dataset annotated. We created a list of categories that may or may not pertain to each comment in the data set to help us create a machine learning model. These guidelines would be the basis for each annotation. We outlined the categories and defined them to guide the annotators. The categories were all annotated if the text was related or not (binary). Our categories were Technology related, Internet Cost, Internet Speed, and Internet Accessibility.
